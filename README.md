simulation_challenge.py

This is an application that takes in a number of families as input and outputs the kids of each family. Each family has an 80% chance of having a girl and 20% chance of having a boy. Once a family has a boy they have no more kids. Finally once all families are created as per the rules, the program will output the girls and boys in each family. This took about 30-40 minutes to complete.

model_eval.ipynb

This is an assignment from a Coursera class through the university of michigan. This notebook uses transaction fraud data to build a few different models and evaluate their effectiveness over a set of metrics such as precision, recall, and AUC. All functions were submitted to an autograder where I received full points for the assignment, this took about an hour to complete

citation_model.ipynb

This is the final assignment for the applied machine learning coursera course through the university of michigan. A training set of citation data was provided along with a test set. I had to determine variables that correlated to the classification of whether the citation would eventually be paid or not. Some data exploration is not shown in this notebook but the function goes through the data cleaning and prepartion prior to training the model.
